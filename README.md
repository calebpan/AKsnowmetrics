# AKsnowmetrics
The purpose of this repository is to provide users an easy way to access, visualize, and quickly process the MODIS derived snow 
metrics. For example, this repository provides tools to extract bands from a multi band snow metric geotif and will convert
the stored values from snow year to a water year. Also provided is a tool to interpolate the MODIS snow metrics to match a 6.25 km 
passive microwave brightness temperature retrieval.
